NOTICE:

The build requires rather complex installation of coq-tactician
related tools and currently we are not supporting building *.bin files
accross all environments.

As of the current situation, for the generation and maintenance of
unit-test *.bin files ask Vasily.


* Building the unit test from coq sources

To build the *.bin files for the unit test dataset change diretory to
the directory of the corresponding unit test (containing Makefile) and
run `make all`.

You will get *.bin files in the subdirectory `dataset` and also capnp
api that was used to generate *.bin files
