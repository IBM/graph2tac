    # This warning seems to be triggered by deleting eager functions.
    # It is hard to track down, but it is likely related to
    # the hacks we do with the tensorflow context in the tests
    # which resets the context between tests.
    # In particular, it doesn't always occur,
    # suggesting it is closesly related to caching of results,
    # and if a result is cached, then we may not need to clear out a context.
    # In conclusion it seems safe to ignore.
